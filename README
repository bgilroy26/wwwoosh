a (sort of) sinatra-like web application framework for bash (yes, bash), with a CGI interface

notes
=====

hopefully it's obvious, but these projects are for fun and not meant to be taken seriously. wwwoosh can only handle about 2 request per second (any additional fail completely), not to mention there's probably some pretty nasty security issues with it.

it is, however, a testament to the simplicity of HTTP, and the power of unix shells
